# completed second problem and understood why we use set and dictionary
in the second problem i realised that there could be 2 solutions but the other one is less effecive as there is less clarity while explaning and also it uses equal or mored memory even after the dublicate eement is found.
today got done with valid anagram and look sgood 
completed group anagram understood differences
